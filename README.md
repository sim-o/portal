# Portal
A reimplementation of [Portal](https://github.com/ericTsiliacos/portal). A command to help in swapping code between pairs when pair programming.

## Installation
Copy the `portal` script into your project's scripts directory.

## Getting started
Unlike the original portal command, this only supports [git-duet](https://github.com/git-duet/git-duet). Set it up before using portal.

## Push
Push local changes to a branch named for the current pair and timestamp. Following the template 'portal-\[pairs]-\[ios-8601-ish time]'

## Pull
Pull changes from the most recent portal branch for the current pair into the working copy of the local branch.
